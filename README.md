# UW-Lecture-Room-Availability
This program is written in Dr Racket. Search your lecture room in the "lectureSearch.rkt" file to find all the time slots that the lecture room is available or occupied by a lecture.

Read the comments at the top of "lectureSearch.rkt" file to understand how to use the program.

Useful for searching lecture rooms that make good study rooms, finding places to meet for events (like movies), or save walking time between lectures!
